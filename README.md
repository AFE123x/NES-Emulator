# NES Emulator

## Introduction

- This project has been something I've been trying to do since December 2023. I've rewritten the code a total of 4 times. First in C++, attempted it in Rust, then C, then C++. I'm doing it in Rust again, but it's different; I read the book and know my way around the Rust Programming Language.

## Development Stage

At this point, I'm just making the CPU emulator again. It'll be challenging but fun (hopefully)
