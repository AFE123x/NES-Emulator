# NES Emulator

The objective of this project is to produce a fully functioning NES emulator. This is not easy; this is my third time attempting this project. I've been involved in computer architecture, so that'll be the successful attempt I've been waiting for. 

## CPU

The CPU is the Ricoh 2A03, a "clone" of Mos Technologies 6502. As you can see, I'm implementing this in C, despite wanting to avoid touching C again (I kid).
